    Component is an occurrence whose prototype is a NXOpen.Part. See
    NXOpen.NXObject.Prototype.

    

    Components are arranged in a tree, with each component having a single parent, and one
    or more children. The top of the tree is the Root Component (see
    NXOpen.Assemblies.ComponentAssembly.RootComponent which has a 
    parent. The components below the root are referred to as "Top Level" components, which
    represent the component parts that have been added directly to the
    ComponentAssembly. (Calling NXOpen.Assemblies.ComponentAssembly.AddComponent will
    create a new Top Level component.) Components beneath the top level represent
    components defined in sub-assemblies of the main assembly.
