    The Routing SBendCorner defines a S-Bend. There are 5 possible S-bend types. 

The UI input is two work part line segment-ending RCPs, each of which
implicitly provides a 3D point and vector.  An S-bend heals the
separation between the two segments with a C1 continuous spline segment.


To disambiguate among 5 S-bend types (see below), the user may need to
further indicate whether the S-bend starts bending immediately at the
end of one or both of the 2 input segments.  Some arrangements of 2
segments do not require further user input to disambiguate among the
possible S-bend types.


The direction vectors of the 2 input segments must either be 
perpendicular (types 1,2,3) or parallel (types 4,5).


The closest distance between the (infinite) lines containing the input
segments must be less that twice the bend radius.  If this condition
does not hold, then 2 right angle bends could connect the 2 input
segments, i.e., an S-bend is unnecessary.


Every S-bend has two bends, whose radii are always equal.  Except for
type 2 and 3, the bend angles are equal and in the range
[ Pi4, Pi2 ].


S-bends never cause a cutback of an input segment, although type 1,2,4
S-bends may add a straight line extension to one of the segment ends
before the bending starts.  Type 1 S-bends may add a straight line
extension to both segment ends.


INPUT
 
     R bend radius, which the user supplies, e.g., from a bend table.
     P1 Work part X,Y,Z of segment 1's end.
     Vec1 Tangent at P1, pointing toward the open end of the segment.
     P2, Vec2 Similar to segment 1 above...
  


    For computation solving purposes, the above input becomes a bend
    radius, height, width, and possibly a depth.


 OUTPUT bend angle(s):
 
 a (alpha)   (all S-bend types)
 g (gamma)   (Type 3 only)
 Extension lengths, if any.



Bend angles are computed at the centers of the bend arcs


S-bends fall into two categories:



    End tangents are perpendicular.

        Three types are possible.  In the 3D diagrams below:
        

            The constructor line, AB, is the perpendicular distance
            between the lines that the segments define.

            from segment 1 is always 90 degrees, and thus terminates
            somewhere in the plane A,B,P2.  The bend from segment 1 always
            starts on an extension of segment 1 that is a distance R from
            A.

            Segment 2 may also have to extend toward B before its bend

                 The bend from segment 1 always starts on an extension of

             The bend radius isn't big enough to span the height so a
            middle straight line segment is necessary.

             Neither segment can have an extension, i.e., the bends start
            at P1 and P2.  Unlike in Type 2, segment 2's bend does not lie
            in the plane A,B,P2, i.e., both bends immediately start
            bending toward each other.
            
        
        

         End tangents are parallel, i.e., bend lies entirely within a
        plane.  This category falls into two types.

    """

            The NXOpen.Routing.Stock object represents a material (such as as pipe or tube)
            that covers a path of segments.  The material is defined in the NXOpen.Routing.StockData
            object.  NXOpen.Routing.Stock consists of a NXOpen.Routing.StockData
            object, as well as references to at most one of the NXOpen.Routing.CrossSection and
            NXOpen.Routing.Anchor objects that are associated with that
            NXOpen.Routing.StockData.

        
            A NXOpen.Routing.Stock object may exist in one of two modes ; Legacy Stock or
            Stock as Components Stock.  Legacy Stock is modeled as a sweep feature in the work part.  Stock
            as Components Stock is modeled as a child component (of the work part) that contains a sweep
            feature.  Legacy Stock and Stock as Components stock cannot exist in the same part file with
            the exception of Bundled stock.
        
            Stock as Components Stock creates a component file, and creates a copy of itself inside of
            that part file.  Segments, anchors, and all other necessary information are copied into
            the component part file.  The stock inside of the component file should not be edited or
            modified as it is completely controlled by the Stock as Component Stock in the work part.
        
        
            NXOpen.Routing.Stock object that have automatically been generated by the bundling
            algorithm used for routing wires are Bundled stock.  Bundled stocks are always created as
            Legacy Stocks (even in parts containing Stock as Component stocks).  Any NXOpen.Routing.StockData
             object that defines a bundled stock has a type of Routing.StockDataType.Bundled
            .  Editing the segments or the stock data of a Bundled stock may result in undefined
            behavior.
        
            With the exception of stock style, there are no functional differences between the two
            stock types.  Stock as Components Stock always uses the NXOpen.Routing.StockStyle.Detailed
            style (if available, otherwise it uses the NXOpen.Routing.StockStyle.Simple style) and
            the stock's style cannot be changed.
