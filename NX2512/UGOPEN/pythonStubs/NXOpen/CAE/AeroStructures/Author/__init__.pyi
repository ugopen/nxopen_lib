                            The yield criteria of isotropic materials limit the elastic domain during loading.
                            According to the Tresca criterion, yield failure is expected when the greatest shear stress reaches the shear strength of the material.
                            Thus, the maximum shear stress yield criterion can be specified as
                            'max((|S1-S2|)2 , (|S1-S3|)2, (|S2-S3|)2) &lt;= (STresca)2'

                             'S1', 'S2' and 'S3' are the principal stresses.
                             'STresca' is the Tresca equivalent stress allowable  
                            A margin of safety can be derived from this formulation:

                            that must be greater than 0.
                            In a plane stress configuration, principal stresses are computed as
                            'S1 = (FX + FY)2 + sqrt(((FX-FY)2)^2 + FXY^2)'
