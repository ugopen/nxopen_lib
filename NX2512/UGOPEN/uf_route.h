    Open C API interface to the Routing (ROUTE) module.

The Routing module within NX provides functions to model
the systems within an overall assembly which supply power, dispose of
waste, provide structural support, or enable general access to the
devices in the assembly. It is a set of common functions appropriate to
the modeling of various types of routing applications, such as Piping,
Tubing, Conduit, etc.
See the Routing User Guide for an overview of the routing design
process and a description of Routing Application Views.

Concepts and Terminology:
-------------------------
Included within the Routing module are functions to define the paths
through an assembly, to assign stock (e.g., pipes, tubes) to these paths,
and to place standard parts (e.g., tees, elbows) to connect the various
pieces of stock in the assembly.

Because Routing is a generic module which supports various
applications, you must select specific capabilities for your particular
use. This is accomplished through the "loading" of a particular
Routing Application View.  The Application View selects the specific
Routing capabilities and customizable options that are in effect
while creating and modifying Routing objects. The application view
can also define user preferences; values keyed by name are available to
you while your application is running. See UF_ROUTE_ask_user_preferences
and the application view documentation for more information.

Once an Application View has been loaded and made the current
Application View, you may use the Routing functions described in this
chapter to build your routing assembly. This involves the definition of
the paths along which stock is to be placed and the placement of
standard parts within the assembly.

Routing Control Points (RCPs) are used to define positions within the
routing assembly. RCPs are connected to one another by the creation
of routing Segments. Segments can be a simple linear connection
between RCPs or may be defined to follow an existing NX
curve. The available curve types which a Segment may follow are
defined by the Application View.

A set of connected Segments is referred to as a routing. The set of
Segments between any two RCPs is referred to as a path.

Once the Segments have been created, you may assign the stock
(pipe, tube, etc.) that should exist along those Segments. A particular
type of stock is defined within a separate NX part file and
the information about the stock is read from the stock part and
included in the current work part. Once this information has been
included in the current work part, you may assign this stock to one or
more sets of Segments within the assembly. A Stock Data object is the
NX object which maintains the common information about
the stock. A Stock object is used to point to this Stock Data object and
the Segments to which this stock has been assigned.
You may also create Bend or Miter Corners at the intersection of 2
Segments to model the bending or mitering of the stock along those
Segments. Bend corners may be created by means of a radius, a ratio to
the diameter, or through a table. Bend radius tables are specified in
the application view. You must know the table name to create the corner.

In addition to the creation of paths and the assignment of stock, you
may place standard parts such as fittings, connectors, and devices,
within the overall assembly. You add such a part as an assembly
components of the current work part and then instruct the Routing
module to "set" this part within the Routing assembly. Routing
automatically determines which Segments the component part has
been placed upon and adjusts the Segments to match the connection
points, known as routing Ports, defined within the part. Orientation
and positioning of the component is handled through the the normal
Assembly functions for adding a component.

Both Stock parts and Fitting parts must be qualified for use by the
Routing module prior to their use by the Routing functions. See the
Routing User Guide for an explanation of the Qualify Part
function. A part, either stock or fitting, need only be qualified once
prior to its use. Sample Stock and Fitting parts are provided with the
Routing product.

A Stock or Fitting part may be a NX Part Family, in which
case you must specify both the part (family) name and the member
name when defining which part to use for a particular operation.

Additional information about Stock objects and Fitting parts for use
by downstream applications may be attached to these objects through
the assignment of Routing characteristics (attributes). Examples of
Routing characteristics might include Material Type, Rating, NPS
(Nominal Pipe Size), and others specified by the Application View.

Characteristics (charx) can be assigned interactively during part qualify,
in the part library, or programmatically. A charx has a type and a title.
It also has a value, which can be a char *, double, or int. Refer to
the documentation for uf_eplib_types.h for more information on the
internals of charx.

Shown below are definitions for various terms used throughout this
documentation. Refer to the Routing User Guide for a complete
glossary of Routing terms.

Application View - A collection of specific Routing capabilities and
attributes that are available to a routing application.  Examples of routing
applications are piping, conduit, tubing, steelwork, raceway, and flexible hose.

characteristic - A datum used in Routing to maintain information which
describes routing objects and records the intended use of the objects.  This
information is used to access standard parts and for other processes such as
design rules, analysis, manufacturing, and BOM reporting.

path - The set of all RCPs (and assigned stock and fittings) between any two
RCPs within a routing.

path segment - A portion of a path between two routing control points.

port - A routing object data element used to specify a connection location,
alignment, or relative orientation with another routing object.

routing control point (RCP) - A position used to control a path.

standard part - A part that has been selected for use on a project because it
meets form, fit, and function requirements of the site.  Standard parts reside
in the standard part library.

stock data - A routing object that contains the cross-sectional and related
characteristics of a stock. There is only one stock_data object for any number
of stock of the same type. For example, all sections of 3 inch steel pipe in
the routing will reference the same stock_data object.

stock - A section of a routing assembly cut from a standard part which is sold
in standard lengths or rolls.  For example: wire, tube or pipe.

nested stock - Stock can be considered as nested when a segment is used to
define the path for more than one routing stock. These multiple stocks on
a segment could belong to the same application( e.g. Pipe inside a bigger
pipe) or different applications ( Wire or a bundle inside a conduit ).

Development Tips:
------------------
.    When creating routing objects with UF_ROUTE_create... functions, it
     is a recommended practice to add them to the current display with
     UF_DISP_add_item_to_display.  The newly created routing objects will
     then be visible in the graphics display without a display regenerate.

Routing functions:
------------------
The subroutines in this header file provide access to creation and
manipulations of routing objects in NX.

The routines in the header file  allow you to:
.    Load and set an Application View.
.    Create RCPs and Segments.
.    Assign Corners such as Bend and Miter.
.    Assign Stocks or Nested Stocks to Segments.
.    Place standard parts within the overall routing.

There are no direct replacements for UF_ROUTE_check_min_bend_radius and UF_ROUTE_check_min_str_length.
You can register the example NX Open bend radius Design Rules found in UFD_Routing_BendRadiusDesignRules.cxx 
in the UGROUTE_MECH kit. Follow the directions in the example and in the Routing Application View (APV) file 
to register the examples. Or you can write your own version of these rules by following the examples in
UFD_Routing_BendRadiusDesignRules.cxx.
