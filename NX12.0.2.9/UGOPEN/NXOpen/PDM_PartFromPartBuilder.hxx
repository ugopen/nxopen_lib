            from an existing part.

             <br> 
            This class is <b>deprecated in NX10</b> for "Save As of master parts" operation.
            This class should only be used in case of Save As Non Master parts and
            Save As New Item Type Operations.
            For Save As of master parts, use @link NXOpen::PDM::PartOperationCopyBuilder NXOpen::PDM::PartOperationCopyBuilder@endlink .
            This class will not support Save As if there are duplicate item ids in database.
             <br> 

             <br> 
            The operation that this builder supports is equivalent to the file save as operation which can:
            <ol>
               <li>Copy a non-master dataset into a previously existing item revision,</li>
               <li>Save a master dataset (and possibly non-master datasets) into a new revision of the same item,</li>
               <li>Save any master or non-master dataset as a completely new item.</li>
            </ol>
             <br> 

             <br> The part that is saved is always the work part. If the save is successful, then the newly
            saved part will be the display part. <br> 

             <br> This class is a singleton meaning only one instance of it can be exist at a time. <br>
