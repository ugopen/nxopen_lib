            @link Features::FeatureReplayBuilder Features::FeatureReplayBuilder@endlink  is used to control the feature replay 
            of a part. Using this class, one can make the first feature or the last feature current, and
            step through the features by making the next feature or previous feature current. This class also 
            allows stepping to the next boolean feature or automatically replay to a given feature. If the 
            feature to be replayed to, is more than the current feature, one can specify a delay 
            (time interval in seconds) between the replay of each of the features to observe the part construction
            with interactive NX session. When interactive NX session is not running, there will be no display of 
            objects / current features.  <br> To create a new instance of this class, use @link Features::FeatureCollection::CreateFeatureReplayBuilder Features::FeatureCollection::CreateFeatureReplayBuilder@endlink  <br> 
        Default values:
        ReplayTimestampNumber: 0
