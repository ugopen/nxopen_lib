        Block Styler Update Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Description
-----------
This Block Styler example is the one given in the Block Styler Update section
of the Block Styler chapters in the NX Open Programmer’s Guide. The example shows 
a minimum number of template source files edits to demonstrate how to handle 
events from various blocks in the given dialog.

--------------
Files required
--------------
1. UpdateExample.vb – VB.NET template source files output by the Block Styler
   with edits made to implement the following dialog behavior.

2. UpdateExample.dlx – the DLX file as generated by the Block Styler.

   The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1.) From where NX session is launched
    2.) $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3.) For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat

---------------
Dialog Behavior
---------------
1. Input String Block - the user may enter a string which will be copied to the Output 
   String Block.
2. Include Number Toggle Block - when this toggle in ON the following number will be
   appended to the Output String Block.
3. Number Integer Block - a slider that the user can use to set a number that is 
   optionally appended to the Output String Block.
4. Output String Block - a String Block that is only used to display the input string 
   and the optional number. This block is always disabled.
5. Lock Input String Toggle - when this toggle is ON the input string is disabled.
6. Lock Number Toggle - when this toggle is ON the number slider is disable.

----------------------

       To do this, right click on "References" under the project in Solution
       Explorer. Pick Add Reference->Browse->Go to %UGII_ROOT_DIR%\out\ugac,
       select DLL.
