        Block Styler Selection Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Description
-----------
This Block Styler example is the one given in the Block Styler Selection 
section of the Block Styler chapters in the NX Open Programmer’s Guide. 
The example shows two selection blocks used to select edges and features. 
It also includes filter callback code for each block.

--------------
Files required
--------------
1. SelectionExample.vb – VB.NET template source files output by the Block Styler
   with edits made to implement the following dialog behavior.

2. SelectionExample.dlx – the DLX file as generated by the Block Styler.

   The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1.) From where NX session is launched
    2.) $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3.) For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat

---------------
Dialog Behavior
---------------
1. Edge Select Block – this selection block will select edges that Chamfer features
   will be applied to.
2. Face Limit Toggle Block – when this toggle in ON the edges that are selected
   will be limited to just the edges on a single face. Also, when this toggle is
   first turned ON, the edge selection list is cleared.
3. Angle Double Block – this value is used to define the angle of the Chamfer features.
4. Feature Select Block – this selection block will select Chamfer features that are removed.
5. Angle Limit Toggle – when this toggle is ON the Chamfer features are limited to those 
   that have the angle in the next block. Also, when this toggle is first turned on the 
   selected Chamfer features are cleared.
6. Angle Limit Double – when this toggle is ON the value is this block is used to limit
   Chamfer selection to only those of the given angle.
