<h3>CreateNote</h3>
<p>This example creates notes by either copying an existing note or creating a 
note from a user defined symbol.</p>
<h4>How to run the example</h4>
<p>Instructions for Windows: All commands are the same as in Unix except 
substitute &quot;make&quot; with &quot;nmake -f Makefile_win&quot;</p>
<ol>
	<li>Compile the example.<pre>make</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Start NX.</li>
	<li>In NX, open a part. If you have one that has a note in it, that would be 
	helpful. If not, open any part or an new/empty part.</li>
	<li>Go to File - Execute - NX Open, select CreateNoteExample.jar and press 
	Ok.</li>
	<li>On the dialog, select either the &quot;create from user defined symbol&quot; or 
	&quot;copy existing note&quot; option.<br>
	For create from user defined symbol:
	<ol>
		<li>Select the name of the user defined symbol and the symbol's size and 
		aspect ratio.</li>
		<li>Click the &quot;Create&quot; button.</li>
		<li>Pick the location for the new note. The note will be created in the 
		XY plane of the WCS. <br>
		You can create as many copies as you want. </li>
		<li>When you are finished, cancel when prompted for the location.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>For copy existing note:
	<ol>
		<li>Click the &quot;Create&quot; button.</li>
		<li>Select a note to copy. You can select one that existed previously in 
		the part or select<br>
		one that was just created.</li>
		<li>Pick the location for the new note. The note will be created in the 
		XY plane of the WCS. <br>
		You can create as many copies as you want. </li>
		<li>When you are finished, cancel when prompted for the location.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<h4>Design notes</h4>
<p>The key portions of code are UserSymbolDialog.getNoteCreationData, 
UserSymbolDialog.loadSymbolNames, and the call to Annotations.createNote in 
main(). Most of the rest of the code is just for the GUI for the example. 
loadSymbolNames() reads the names of the available user defined symbols from the 
selected Symbol Font Definition file (sbf file). getNoteCreationData() gets the 
text and preferences for the new note. If &quot;copy existing note&quot; was selected, 
getNoteCreationData prompts the user to pick a note and gets the text and 
preferences for the new note from the selected note. If &quot;create from user 
defined symbol&quot; is selected, the user symbol that was selected is loaded into 
the part and the user symbol preferences for the new note are constructed based 
on what the user specified on the form. Then, the main subroutine prompts the 
user for the location for the new note and creates the note.</p>
