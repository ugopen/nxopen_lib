	USING OTHER PARTS
    -------------------
	A part other than the example part can be used. However, there are two issues 
	that we need to take care of.
		
		1) The file special.sbf, must be at the same file location as the 
		part you want to use.

		2) The preferences related to lettering size may be set in the part
		may cause the title block text to not show optimally.
