             Pick "Add Reference..." and then navigate to the location of the dlls. 
             These dlls can be found in %UGII_ROOT_DIR%\managed.

   5. In the Solution Explorer highlight the project name and use the 3rd mouse

Notes
-----------------------
	1. "NXOpen application must be signed before its release. If not signed the application may not get executed.
	    For more details on signing the application refer to NXOpen Programmer's Guide."
	
	2. User will require a .NET authoring license to run the example. See the online documentation for details of licensing.

	3. This uses the .Net Windows Forms open file dialog to select a .txt file. The file is read a line at a time and the
	   line is parsed into 3 doubles. Points are created using this data.
	   The points are created invisible and must be made visible explicitly.

	4. FILE FORMAT:
	   The text file read should have one point per line. Each point is a comma separated list of three numbers. 
	   An Example to create points at the corners of a square is:

	   --- start of file ---
	   0,0,0
	   1,0,0
	   1,1,0
	   0,1,0
	   --- end of file ---
