Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------
The UpdateExample.dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
	
   1. From where NX session is launched
   2. $UGII_USER_DIR/application
   3. For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
       recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
       containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
       e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat

----------------------------
Settings after Launching NX
----------------------------
   1. Change the Role to Advanced with full menus.
