Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------

The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1. From where NX session is launched
    2. $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3. For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat


----------------------------
Settings after Launching NX
----------------------------

 1. Change the Role to Advanced with full menus.

           3.1 Using Tools->Journal->Play  
            
                  - Invoke SelectionExample.vb file using Tools->Journal->Play (Alt+F8).
               
           3.2 By creating Shared Library and invoke SelectionExample.dll through File->Execute->NX Open Menu (Ctrl+U).

               first turned ON, the edge selection list is cleared.
         6.3 Angle Double Block – this value is used to define the angle of the Chamfer features.
