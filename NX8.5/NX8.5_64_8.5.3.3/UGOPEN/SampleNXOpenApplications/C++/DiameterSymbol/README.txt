        		Add/Remove Diameter Symbol to Dimension Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------
Example Description
-------------------
This example provides ability to add/remove diameter symbol to/from selected dimensions.
The symbol is added as a prefix.

--------------
Files required
--------------

    1. Source code - dimpref.hpp and dimpref.cpp
    2. Dialog file - dimpref.dlx

The above listed files are located at
$UGII_BASE_DIR/ugopen/SampleNXOpenApplications/C++/DiameterSymbol

-----------
Build Steps
-----------

   Windows
   -------
   1. Using Visual Studio - create a new project using the NXOpen AppWizard.
      This is described in the Automation -> NXOpen -> Open for C/C++ -> 
      Open C Reference Guide -> Overview -> Setting up your system -> Windows Operating System Setup. 
      When setting the Application Settings, select "Create an Internal application" 
      and select C++ as the language. 

   2. Remove all the existing files from project.
   
   3. Add the dimpref.cpp to Source Files
      by selecting the Project pulldown and select "Add Existing Item...". Select the file 
      using the popup window.

   4. Build the internal image by going to the Build menu and selecting either 
      "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution".
 
   This will create an executable called dimprefix.dll in the Debug directory.

   The uflink tool can also be used to create the executable by following these steps:
   1. Open an NX command prompt window.
   2. Change directories to the directory containing the source code.
   3. Compile and link using uflink:
	
      ufcomp dimprefix.cpp
      uflink UFDLL=dimprefix.dll

   This will create dimprefix.dll in the current directory.

   Linux
   ----
   1. Start up an NX command prompt window then start up ufmenu ($UGII_BASE_DIR/ugopen/ufmenu).
   2. Compile the program accepting the defaults.
   3. Link an internal user function program.
   4. Answer the first question for linking with an "i" (Link internal/external user function (i/e):) 
      Select "y" for the next input to create an application with user interface code
      Select “y” for the next input to Link a UG/Open++ Image (y/n).
   5. Take the default linking options.
   6. Provide the name of the program to link => dimprefix.
   7. Do not add any subroutines or libraries.
       
   This will create dimprefix.so in the current directory.

   Exit out of ufmenu.


----------------------------
Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------
   1. Place dimpref.dlx in your UGII_USER_DIR application directory

----------------------------
Settings after Launching NX
----------------------------
   1. Change the Role to Advanced with full menus if not set.


-----------------------
Example execution steps
-----------------------
    1. Start NX.

    2. Open a part file containing dimensions.
       
    3. Invoke dimprefix.dll (dimprefix.so on Linux) file using  File->Execute->NX Open... menu command.

    4. This will launch the dialog.

    5. Select dimensions to add/remove diameter symbol.
	
    6. Note that the spacing between diameter symbol and dimension value can be controlled using 
       Annotation Preferences -> Lettering -> Dimension/Appended Text Space Factor.
