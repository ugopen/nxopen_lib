Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------
The dlx(s) files must be placed in one of the following locations:
	 1. From where NX session is launched
	 2. $UGII_USER_DIR/application
	 3. For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
	    recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
	    containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
	    e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat
