Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------

   The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
     1. From where NX session is launched
     
     2. $UGII_USER_DIR/application
     
     3. For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat
