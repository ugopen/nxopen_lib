Description

This example demonstrates creation of colored block using the Block Styler .Net APIs. 
The set of APIs designed for Block Styler application are property based. While using 
these APIs one must be aware about the Block, its associated properties and their data type.
Executing this example will launch a dialog which allows you to pick the point and 
color to create a block.

 1. ColoredBlock.vb 
 2. ColoredBlock.dlx (This file is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR/ugopen/SampleNXOpenApplications/C++/BlockStyler/ColoredBlock)

Settings before Launching NX
----------------------------
The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1. From where NX session is launched
    2. $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3. For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat
