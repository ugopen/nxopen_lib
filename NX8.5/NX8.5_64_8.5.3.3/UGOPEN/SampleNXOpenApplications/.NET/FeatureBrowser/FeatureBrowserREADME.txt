        		Feature Browser Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Description
-----------
This example queries all the open, fully loaded parts in the current NX session, and 
populates a Windows Forms dialog with information on the parts. What this example shows
is how to use the more advanced Windows Forms UI elements that are not readily available
in the UI Styler, such as a TreeView, ListView, and PropertyGrid.

The main form for the application shows a tree view of the open parts. Inside each part 
node in the tree view are a list of the features in each part. If you select a part, 
all the expressions for the part will be displayed in a list view in the upper right. 
If you select an expression in the list view, a subset of the public properties of 
the expression will be displayed in the property grid in the lower right. You can 
change the value of the selected expression by entering a new value for the expression
in the expression's RightHandSide property. Click on the Update button to apply all 
the pending changes to the part and update the part.
