#  The cgmdef.txt file specifies the defaults used to create CGM files
#  for File->Export CGM and File->Export PDF and NX Open functionality.
#
# A # starting a line signifies a comment.  The following keywords are 
# supported:
# EXPORT_VDC_TYPE can be set to either real or integer
# EXPORT_VDC_TYPE   real 
# 
# Export Font Mapping.  
#
# Individual fonts can be mapped specifically by specifying the
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT keyword.  The first font will be the NX font, 
# and the second font the corresponding font that will be used in 
# the CGM file.  The CGM file can use a standard TrueType font, or
# you can specify a traditional CGM font like Hershey:Simplex_Roman.
# If a font contains an embedded space, replace the space with a #, since
# the space is used as a delimiter.  So to specify Times New Roman use:
#
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT blockfont Times#New#Roman
#
# The # will be replaced prior to the font being used in the CGM file.
# Fontnames should be specified in the proper case, NX fonts should be
# all lower case and TrueType fonts should be mixed case.  Specifying NX
# fonts as all upper case will work to preserve legacy behavior, but is not
# recommended.  It is recommended that you use the case sensitive names for
# all fonts, which means lower case for NX fonts.
#
# A special font name of "ALL_UG_FONTS" can be used to map all NX fonts
# to a single CGM font, e.g:
#
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT ALL_UG_FONTS            HERSHEY:SIMPLEX_ROMAN
#
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT mdcfont                 HERSHEY:SIMPLEX_ROMAN
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT blackfont               HERSHEY:DUPLEX_ROMAN
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT script                  HERSHEY:SIMPLEX_SCRIPT
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT blockfont               Times#New#Roman
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT Arial#Unicode#MS        Courier#New
# EXPORT_TEXT_FONT leroy                   Arial
#
# The following can be used to map specific fonts in a CGM file back to
# an NX font when a CGM file is imported.  If the CGM file was exported
# with NX fonts, then no mapping is required.  Note that a # will be replaced
# with a space.
#
# IMPORT_TEXT_FONT HERSHEY:SIMPLEX_ROMAN   blockfont 
# IMPORT_TEXT_FONT HERSHEY:SIMPLEX_SCRIPT  Times#New#Roman 
# IMPORT_TEXT_FONT HERSHEY:DUPLEX_ROMAN    blockfont
