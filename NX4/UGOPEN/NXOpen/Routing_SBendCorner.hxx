            The Routing SBendCorner define a S-Bend. There are 5 possible S-bend types. 

        The UI input is two work part line segment-ending RCPs, each of which
        implicitly provides a 3D point and vector.  An S-bend heals the
        separation between the two segments with a C1 continuous spline segment.

        To disambiguate among 5 S-bend types (see below), the user may need to
        further indicate whether the S-bend starts bending immediately at the
        end of one or both of the 2 input segments.  Some arrangements of 2
        segments do not require further user input to disambiguate among the
        possible S-bend types.

        The direction vectors of the 2 input segments must either be 
        perpendicular (types 1,2,3) or parallel (types 4,5).

        The closest distance between the (infinite) lines containing the input
        segments must be less that twice the bend radius.  If this condition
        does not hold, then 2 right angle bends could connect the 2 input
        segments, i.e., an S-bend is unnecessary.

        Every S-bend has two bends, whose radii are always equal.  Except for
        type 2 and 3, the bend angles are equal and in the range
        [ Pi/4, Pi/2 ].

        S-bends never cause a cutback of an input segment, although type 1,2,4
        S-bends may add a straight line extension to one of the segment ends
        before the bending starts.  Type 1 S-bends may add a straight line
        extension to both segment ends.

        INPUT
            R
                Bend radius, which the user supplies, e.g., from a bend table.
            P1
                Work part X,Y,Z of segment 1's end.
            Vec1
                Tangent at P1, pointing toward the open end of the segment.
            P2, Vec2
                Similar to segment 1 above...

            For computation solving purposes, the above input becomes a bend
            radius, height, width, and possibly a depth.

        OUTPUT
            Bend angle(s):
                a (alpha)   (all S-bend types)
                g (gamma)   (Type 3 only)
            Extension lengths, if any.
            [Bend angles are computed at the centers of the bend arcs]

        S-bends fall into two categories:

            o   End tangents are perpendicular.

                Three types are possible.  In the 3D diagrams below:

                    The constructor line, AB, is the perpendicular distance
                    between the lines that the segments define.

                    Height (H):  length of A-B
                    Depth  (D):  length of A-P1
                    Width  (W):  length of B-P2

                    The A-B, A-P1, B-P2 vectors are mutually perpendicular.

                Type 1:  does not have a middle straight line portion.

                    The bend from segment 2 lies in the plane A,B,P2.  The bend
                    from segment 1 is always 90 degrees, and thus terminates
                    somewhere in the plane A,B,P2.  The bend from segment 1 always
                    starts on an extension of segment 1 that is a distance R from
                    A.

                    Segment 2 may also have to extend toward B before its bend
                    starts.

                    Geometrically, the height is the sum of the vertical
                    components of bend 1 and bend 2.

                     B                      P2   seg2

                    Similar to Type 1:
                        The bend from segment 2 lies in the plane A,B,P2.

                        The bend from segment 1 is always 90 degrees, and thus
                        terminates somewhere in the plane A,B,P2.

                        The bend from segment 1 always starts on an extension of
                        segment 1 that is a distance R from A.

                    Unlike Type 1:
                        Segment 2's bend always starts at P2, i.e., segment 2
                        never has an extension.

                     B                    P2   seg2

                    The bend radius isn't big enough to span the height so a
                    middle straight line segment is necessary.

                    Neither segment can have an extension, i.e., the bends start
                    at P1 and P2.  Unlike in Type 2, segment 2's bend does not lie
                    in the plane A,B,P2, i.e., both bends immediately start
                    bending toward each other.

            o   End tangents are parallel, i.e., bend lies entirely within a
                plane.  This category falls into two types.

                               A          E2        P2   seg2

                    The height, H, is length (A-P1), where A is the projection of
                    P1 onto the line that seg2 defines.

                    Because both bend angles are the same, the bends meet at half
                    the height H/2.
