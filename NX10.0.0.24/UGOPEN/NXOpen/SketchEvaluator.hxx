              *     [2] The application should edit the properties "CreateCurveOption", "SimplifyCurveOption"
              *         as needed before calling this method.
              *
              *  Post-conditions:
              *     [3] If the "create curve" option is set to false, the output curves should be 
              *         accessed right away.
              *         The lifetime of these curves is as long as the next call to method "EvaluateOneSketch".
              *
              *     [4] If the application wants to evaluate the same sketch at multiple path location,
              *         it should make several consecutive calls to method "EvaluateOneSketch".
              *         At the end of the operation, the application must call method "Destroy".
              *
              *     [5] If the "simplify curve" option is false, the number of curves will always be the same.
              *
              *     [6] The design of this functionality has not been tailored for master section
              *         with multiple loops. If the master section has multiple loops, all the curves
              *         will be returned in the order of the loops in the section. 
              *      
              *     [7] Method "EvaluateOneSketch" changes the state of the sketch on path. Therefore,
              *         the part is temporarily in out of date state. The application should leverage
              *         the NX undo mechanism to reset the state to its original. An alternative solution
              *         is to suppress and unsuppress the sketch on path and variational sweep features
              *         involved.
