The files in this folder are sample CAM programs. They can be run as is, 
but they are intended to be examples that you can modify for your own use. 
These are run from within an interactive NX session.

These programs show how to modify CAM objects selected in the Operation 
Navigator, cycle all objects and edit only specific types and subtypes, 
and how to modify an object provided by a CAM Wizard.

Each file contains a description of its function and use, and has comments 
throughout the file to guide you in adapting the program for your use.
