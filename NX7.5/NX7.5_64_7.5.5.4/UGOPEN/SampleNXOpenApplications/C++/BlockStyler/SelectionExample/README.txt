        Block Styler Selection Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Description
-----------
This Block Styler example is the one given in the Block Styler Selection 
section of the Block Styler chapters in the NX Open Programmer’s Guide. 
The example shows two selection blocks used to select edges and features. 
It also includes filter callback code for each block.

--------------
Files required
--------------
1. SelectionExample.cpp – C++ template source files output by the Block Styler
   with edits made to implement the following dialog behavior.

2. SelectionExample.hpp – C++ template header file output by the Block Styler.

3. SelectionExample.dlx – the DLX file as generated by the Block Styler.

   The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1.) From where NX session is launched
    2.) $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3.) For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat

---------------
Dialog Behavior
---------------
1. Edge Select Block – this selection block will select edges that Chamfer features
   will be applied to.
2. Face Limit Toggle Block – when this toggle in ON the edges that are selected
   will be limited to just the edges on a single face. Also, when this toggle is
   first turned ON, the edge selection list is cleared.
3. Angle Double Block – this value is used to define the angle of the Chamfer features.
4. Feature Select Block – this selection block will select Chamfer features that are removed.
5. Angle Limit Toggle – when this toggle is ON the Chamfer features are limited to those 
   that have the angle in the next block. Also, when this toggle is first turned on the 
   selected Chamfer features are cleared.
6. Angle Limit Double – when this toggle is ON the value is this block is used to limit
   Chamfer selection to only those of the given angle.

How to Build C++ examples
-------------------------

   Windows
   -------
   1. Using Visual Studio - create a new project using the NX Open AppWizard.
      This is described in the Automation -> NXOpen -> Open for C/C++ -> 
	  Open C Reference Guide -> Overview -> Setting up your system. 
	  When setting the Application Settings,
      select "Create an Internal application" and select C++ as the language. 

   2. Remove all the existing files from project.
   
   3. Add the SelectionExample.cpp, SelectionExample.hpp to Source Files and Header Files respectively 
      by selecting the Project pulldown and select "Add Existing Item...". Select the file 
      using the popup window.

   4. Build the internal image by going to the Build menu and selecting either 
      "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution".
 
   This will create an executable called SelectionExample.dll in the Debug directory.

   The uflink tool can also be used to create the executable by following these steps:
   1. Open an NX command prompt window.
   2. Change directories to the directory containing the source code.
   3. Compile and link using uflink:

      uflink UFDLL=SelectionExample.dll

   This will create SelectionExample.dll in the current directory.

   Unix
   ----
   1. Start up an NX command prompt window then start up ufmenu ($UGII_BASE_DIR/ugopen/ufmenu).
   2. Compile the program accepting the defaults.
   3. Link an internal user function program.
   4. Answer the first question for linking with an "i" (Link internal/external user function (i/e):) 
      Select "y" for the next input to create an application with user interface code
      Select “y” for the next input to Link a UG/Open++ Image (y/n).
   5. Take the default linking options.
   6. Provide the name of the program to link => SelectionExample
   7. Do not add any subroutines or libraries.
       
   This will create SelectionExample.so in the current directory.

   Exit out of ufmenu.

----------------------
How to Run C++ Example
----------------------

Once you have successfully finished with "How to Build C++ example" steps, follow the steps below:

    1. Start NX. On Unix, this must be done using ugmenu or $UGII_ROOT_DIR/ugii.
    2. Create a new part and insert some geometery suitable for chamfering, e.g. a Block or an Extrude.
    3. Go to the menu, File -> Execute -> NX Open… OR press “Ctrl+U” on the keyboard to launch the 
       "Execute User Function" dialog. Navigate and select SelectionExample.dll (SelectionExample.so
       in Linux) through the dialog and press OK.
    4. This should launch the SelectionExample dialog.
    5. Select an edge on the solid body to chamfer and enter the desired chamfer angle value. Then 
       click "Apply" to chamfer the selected edge with the specified chamfer angle.
	6. Click on the block titled "Select Chamfers to Remove". This allows the selection of 
	   chamfer features on the body that is intended to be removed or deleted. 
       Hit "OK" on the dialog to delete the selected chamfer.
