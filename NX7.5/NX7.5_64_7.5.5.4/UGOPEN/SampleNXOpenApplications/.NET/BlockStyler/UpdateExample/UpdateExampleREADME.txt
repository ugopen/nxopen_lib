        Block Styler Update Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Description
-----------
This Block Styler example is the one given in the Block Styler Update section
of the Block Styler chapters in the NX Open Programmer’s Guide. The example shows 
a minimum number of template source files edits to demonstrate how to handle 
events from various blocks in the given dialog.

--------------
Files required
--------------
1. UpdateExample.vb – VB.NET template source files output by the Block Styler
   with edits made to implement the following dialog behavior.

2. UpdateExample.dlx – the DLX file as generated by the Block Styler.

   The dlx file must be placed in one of the following locations:
    1.) From where NX session is launched
    2.) $UGII_USER_DIR/application
    3.) For released applications, using UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE is highly
        recommended. This variable is set to a full directory path to a file 
        containing a list of root directories for all custom applications.
        e.g., UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE=<NX install directory>\ugii\menus\custom_dirs.dat

---------------
Dialog Behavior
---------------
1. Input String Block - the user may enter a string which will be copied to the Output 
   String Block.
2. Include Number Toggle Block - when this toggle in ON the following number will be
   appended to the Output String Block.
3. Number Integer Block - a slider that the user can use to set a number that is 
   optionally appended to the Output String Block.
4. Output String Block - a String Block that is only used to display the input string 
   and the optional number. This block is always disabled.
5. Lock Input String Toggle - when this toggle is ON the input string is disabled.
6. Lock Number Toggle - when this toggle is ON the number slider is disable.

----------------------
How to execute the example
----------------------
1. Using Tools->Journal->Play 

	1. Start NX.
	2. Create new part.
	3. Read the instruction under DIALOG LAUNCHING section of UpdateExample.vb
	   in order to understand where to keep the UpdateExample.dlx file.
	4. Invoke UpdateExample.vb file using Tools->Journal->Play.
	
2. By creating Shared Library and invoke it through File->Execute->NX Open Menu. 
   
-----------------------
How to Build VB example
-----------------------
1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio .Net.

2. Create a new VB project using the NX Open AppWizard. This is described in the 
   NX Open Programmers Guide -> Wizard Setup.
   Also information under Creating NX Open Automation -> Applications will be helpful.
   When setting the Application Settings, select "Create an Internal application"
   and select NXOpen.UI API. 
   Select to activate the application Explicitly and to unload when NX terminates.
   Then pick Finish.

3.  Add the UpdateExample.vb to the project by selecting the Project pulldown and select 
    "Add Existing Item...". Select the file using the popup window.

4. Build the internal image by going to the Build menu and selecting either "Build" or "Rebuild".

This will create an executable called UpdateExample.dll in the Release directory.
