File Description:
The Open API MenuScript which augments the menubar customization and
application integration features provided by MenuScript.

Extensive customization of the NX menubar can be accomplished using
menu files without performing any C programming.  These capabilites are
described in the "Open API MenuScript User Guide".

The integration of complete applications or extension of standard NX
applications using custom menu items that execute callbacks written in C is
documented in the MenuScript sections of the "Open API Reference" and the
"Open API Programmer's Guide".  The declarations and prototypes for the Open API
MenuScript are included below.

The functions prototyped in uf_mb.h provide the programmatic interface to
Open API MenuScript which provides:
.    Lets NX customers and third-party developers use ASCII files to
     edit NX menus and create custom menus for their own applications
     in an integrated, seamless manner. Menu files support custom tailoring of
     the main menu bar and the Quick View Pop-up menu.
.    supports pre and post actions for menu items, providing a capability
     similar to that of User Exits, for both standard NX menu items and
     those provided by third-party applications developed with the Open API
.    provides a Menubar Report Tool to help review menu customization, diagnose
     problems, and assist in upgrading to future NX releases.
.    provides for extensive customization of NX menus including adding,
     removing, and rearranging menu items, and duplicating or moving menu items
     from the main menu bar to the Quick View Pop-up menu. Added menu items can
     execute existing GRIP or Open API programs, perform system commands
     (including running a program or journal), open a UIStyler dialog, or open
     a User Tool palette.

All of these customization techniques can be accomplished without requiring any
C programming. These capabilities, along with complete information on the format
and usage of MenuScript menu files, MenuScript environment variables and command
line arguments, and the Menubar Report Tool are included in the Open
MenuScript User Guide.

NOTE:  You must be thoroughly familiar with the information in the Open
MenuScript User Guide to use the functions documented in this chapter. Please
review the information in the User Guide prior to using the MenuScript API.

Associates a UIStyler dialog to an associated action specified in a Menuscript

in the "application" directory underneath the directory which has been added to
the file $UGII_BASE_DIR/ugii/menu/custom_dirs.dat.

For example, on an NT system, you could specify d:\my_application
as your directory.

The actions structure provides the binding of callbacks and client data
to the dialog.  You may associate multiple dialogs in your actions
structure provided that the list is NULL terminated.
