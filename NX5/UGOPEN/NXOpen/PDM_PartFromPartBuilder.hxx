             <br> 
            The operation that this builder supports is equivalent to the file save as operation which can:
            <ol>
               <li>Copy a non-master dataset into a previously existing item revision,</li>
               <li>Save a master dataset (and possibly non-master datasets) into a new revision of the same item,</li>
               <li>Save any master or non-master dataset as a completely new item.</li>
            </ol>
             <br> 

             <br> The part that is saved is always the work part. If the save is successful, then the newly
            saved part will be the display part. <br> 

             <br> This class is a singleton meaning only one instance of it can be exist at a time. <br>
