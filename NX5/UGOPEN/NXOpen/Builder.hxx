    A Builder is an object that is used to create and edit other objects. This is an abstract
    class that provides the basic functionality common to all builders. See the Builder
    subclasses for details of application-specific builders.
     <br> 
    All Builders use a transaction model. A new builder is created, and its methods are called
    to make changes. These changes are not applied to the session until the
    @link Builder::Commit Builder::Commit@endlink  method is invoked.
     <br> 
     <br> 
    Once a Builder has been committed, it should be deleted using the
    @link Builder::Destroy Builder::Destroy@endlink . Alternatively, any edits made can be discarded by
    deleting the builder without calling commit.
