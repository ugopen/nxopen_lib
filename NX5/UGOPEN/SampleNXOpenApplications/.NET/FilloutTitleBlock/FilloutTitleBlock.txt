This example shows one possible use for journaling for use in Drafting.

In this example, we will take a part, and make a drawing using the template for a C drawing.
At this point, we have a drawing, with an empty title block.  We now run the journal file 
fill_in_title_block_templ.vb.  This will query us for certain fields to put into the drawing.
Fill in the values, and hit OK.  And the title block will be filled in.  This only works for 
a C drawing made using the template.

HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE:
1. Open a part.  An example part has been provided, but any part will do.
2. Select the Template for a C drawing, from the Drawing Templates tab.  Note: If the Drawing Templates tab has not already been set up, it needs to be, see below.
3. After UG is done processing, you will be in Drafting viewing a C drawing sheet.
4. Run the fill_in_title_block_templ.vb journal file.  Use Tools - Journal - Play and use Browse to find the vb file.  Hit Run on the dialog.
5. When prompted, fill in the dialog with the information to populate the title block.  Hit OK when you are satisfied with the information.  
6. The title block will be updated with the information you entered in the dialog.

TEMPLATE SETUP
A. In UG, goto Preferences-Palettes
B. On the Palette dialog choose "Open Palette File"

E. The palette should now be on your resource bar.
F. Go back to step 2 above and select the template for a C drawing.
