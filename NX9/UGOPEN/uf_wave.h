File Description:

     This is the Open API interface to WAVE. These routines allow you to
     manipulate linked features and delayed update control.

     These routines are typically used with routines in uf_so.h. In particular,
     assy_ctxt_xforms are smart objects created using routines in that file.

     Linked features rely on data from other parts. In some cases, therefore,
     the UF_WAVE_xxx routines may require data from parts that are not loaded.
     Where the data is being created or modified, the part is automatically
     loaded first. However, where the data is only needed for an enquiry
     routine, memory considerations mean it may not be appropriate to load the
     part, if it is not already loaded. Hence the enquiry routines have been
     provided with an allow_load argument, which controls whether parts are
     loaded if necessary to supply the data wanted, or if an error
     (UF_WAVE_data_not_loaded) is given instead.

sketches, strings, datums, faces and bodies. Intersection curve strings,
projection curve strings, offset curve and face edge(s) strings can be
reparented to one another.

This routine gets the part file name for the broken link's source part, if it

A link may be broken either because the relation to the source geometry is severed (e.g. the source geometry
is deleted or the link becomes non-associative to the source geometry by hitting the "break link" icon") or
the link's context has changed. In the latter case, the source geometry information still exists. Therefore,
it can be returned provided that the source part is either fully or partially loaded in the session.

This function will return the source part for a broken link provided that (1) the break occurred only because
the link's context changed and (2) the source part is at least partially loaded. In all other other cases, no
source part is returned. The absence of this information is not an error.
