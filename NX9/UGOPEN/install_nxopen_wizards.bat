::
:: This script installs the nxopen_wizards with the following steps.
:: 1. Call :Reg_Query subroutine to find the INSTALLDIR for NX %NX_VER.
:: 2. Check that UGOPEN\vs_files folder exists, if not, exit this script.
:: 3. Call :Reg_query to get installed ProductDir for MS Visual Studio %VC_VER
:: 4. If VC is not found in Registry, may not be installed, exit this script.
:: 5. Check if VC ProductDir exists. May have been deleted. if not, exit.
:: 6. Xcopy the UGOPEN VS Wizard files into VS ProductDir.

:: Version control variables.__________________________________________________
:: The NX version containing UGOPEN\vs_files App Wizard folder.
set NX_VER=8.0
:: The Visual Studio C++ version to place the App Wizards.
set VC_VER=10.0



:: Find and check UGOPEN.______________________________________________________
:: Get NX version %NX_VER installed dir, then set and check %UGOPEN_VS_FILES.
:: Call :Reg_Query to get INSTALLDIR. The subroutine tries both 32 & 64 bit
:: Reg keys to set %VAL. The Product key (arg2) must be quoted.
::
