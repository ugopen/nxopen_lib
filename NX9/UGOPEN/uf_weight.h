UF_WEIGHT_estab_solid_props.

If object is a part, the properties returned are its own, exclusive of the
properties of any components it may have.  If object is a component,
the properties returned do not allow for the position of the
component in the assembly (use UF_WEIGHT_transform_props if
this is desired), and properties stored on the component's prototype
part will not be returned.  If object is a promotion, its returned cache,
if available, is the delta between the properties of the promotion
geometry and the properties of its base solid.

Like the other UF_WEIGHT routines that can take a solid as an
input argument, this routine requires that the solid is not suppressed,
is not a boolean tool, is not a sheet solid, and is not view dependent.
No solids in these categories can sensibly be given weight properties.

Note that exceptions are not applicable to this lower level routine.

Calculations of weight properties will be made to an accuracy of at

solids.  accuracy must be 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999 or 0.999999.

If solid is in the work part, a cache is written on it (if an existing cache
was not available).  Otherwise, the relevant properties are still
returned, but no cache is written.  solid can be a solid occurrence
instead of a solid.  If so, the properties returned are those of the
prototype solid with an appropriate transform applied.  A cache is
written on the prototype solid if it is in the work part, but never on a
solid occurrence.

Like the other UF_WEIGHT routines that can take a solid as an
input argument, this routine requires that the solid is not suppressed,
is not a boolean tool, is not a sheet solid, and is not view dependent.
No solids in these categories can sensibly be given weight properties.
If solid is a promotion, its returned cache is the delta between the
properties of the promotion geometry and the properties of its base
solid.  This ensures that any calculation including both the promotion
and its base returns the correct answer (i.e. the properties of the
promoted geometry).
