        		Selection.vb example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
This example demonstrates alternatives to the code recorded while performing a
'Select All' using various filtering methods before an operation.  The example
shows how filtering by type, detailed type, layers, display attributes and color
can be accomplished via automation. The example gets the datums on the work part
that satisfy the filtering criteria and blanks the datums.
