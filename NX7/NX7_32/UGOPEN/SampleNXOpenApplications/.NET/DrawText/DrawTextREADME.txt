DrawText.vb example

This example shows creating solid bodies in the shape
of text using outlines from TrueType fonts. It takes
advantage of the .Net framework libraries for getting
the outlines of the characters. It also shows some
simple use of user function to create splines.

This example will work with any national language.

HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE
- Open a part.
- Run DrawText.vb from the journal manager. 
- It will prompt for a font - Choose one and hit OK.
- It will prompt for some text - Enter some text and hit OK.
- It will prompt for a position to place the text - Pick a position with the mouse.
- It will prompt for the thickness to extrude the text - Enter a value and hit OK. 
You should see the text in the font specified, extruded into a solid.  The initial profile is always created in the X,Y plane.


DESIGN NOTES
This makes use of Microsoft supplied classes to
get the outline of text in a TrueType font in particular
the GraphicsPathIterator class. This is done in
the Main routine. The outline consists of straight
lines and Bezier curves. Connected sets of the same type
of curve are extracted and processed by either CreateLinearPath
or CreateSplinePath. CreateSplinePath converts from
Bezier representation into B-Spline representation and
uses UFCurve's CreateSpline method to create the spline.

Note that the coordinates from the TrueType outline are 
adjusted so the text is the right way up when viewing down 
the Z axis.

Once the curves are created a sketch is made - this was
derived from recording the creation of a sketch. Then
all geometry is added to the sketch. The main addition
is the sketch creation is retried with different sketch
names until it succeeds to allow for the unique sketch
name rule.

The extrusion routine was also derived from recording
the extrusion of a sketch and simply extrudes the result
of the previous step along the Z axis by the user supplied
depth.


CAVEATS
No attempt is made to handle self intersecting outlines
which can be generated by some font styles - such as strikeout
- or in some languages.

The color of the first body created is different from
all the other bodies which is a known problem.

The screen does not always refresh between steps in the
process so you may not see the curves created while
entering the extrusion thickness.
