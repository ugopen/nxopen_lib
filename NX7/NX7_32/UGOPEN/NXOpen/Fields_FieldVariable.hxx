             <br> A variable is a symbol on whose value a function, polynomial, etc., depends. For example,
            the variables in the function <b><tt>f(x,y)</tt></b> are <b><tt>x</tt></b> and <b><tt>y</tt></b>. A
            function having a single variable is said to be univariate, one having two variables is said to be
            bivariate, and one having three or more variables is said to be multivariate.  In NX, variables in
            this sense are specifically referred to as independent variables. <br> 

             <br> In NX, variables are also used to describe the output of a function; these are referred to
            as the <b><tt>dependent variables</tt></b>.  In NX, a field with a single dependent variable is
            called a <b><tt>scalar field</tt></b>, with three variables of the same measure a <b><tt>vector field</tt></b>,
            all others are simply referred to as fields. <br> 

             <br> In NX, all variables have a measure and associated unit type specification (see also
            @link Unit Unit@endlink ). <br>
