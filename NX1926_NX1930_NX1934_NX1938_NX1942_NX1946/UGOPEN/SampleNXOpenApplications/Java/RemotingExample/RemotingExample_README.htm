<h3>RemotingExample</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to use remoting with NX Open for Java.  This example
implements getUnloadOption and onUnload so the server can be stopped while NX is running.  It
is possible to restart the server as well.</p>
<h4>How to run the example</h4>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, the commands in these instructions must be run from 
an NX command prompt.&nbsp; See the general notes of the examples for 
<a href="../README.htm#How_to_start_an_NX_command_prompt">instructions on how to start an NX command prompt</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions for Windows: All commands are the same as in Unix except 
substitute &quot;make&quot; with &quot;nmake -f Makefile_win&quot;.</p>
<p>This example uses port 1099 for rmiregistry (the default port).&nbsp; Make 
sure that no other application is using port 1099.&nbsp; You can use netstat to 
check this.&nbsp; The example will start rmiregistry if it is not already 
running.&nbsp; If another application is using port 1099, rmiregistry may fail 
to start.&nbsp; If the example does not run correctly after you follow the 
instructions below for running the example, you can check whether rmiregistry 
started successfully using &quot;ps -ef | grep rmiregistry&quot; on Unix or using the 
Windows Task Manager on Windows.&nbsp; On Windows, if you cannot determine which 
process is using port 1099, you may need to restart Windows. </p>
<h5>Batch mode</h5>
<pre>make run</pre>
<p>The program will create two lines, and arc, print data about the geometry to 
stdout, and will save the part.</p>
<h5>Interactive mode</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Compile the example<pre>make clean
make
make run_rmiregistry</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Start NX.</li>
	<li>In NX, go to File - Execute - NX 
		Open, select NXRemoteServerImpl.class, and press Ok.&nbsp; The listing 
	window will display a message
	<pre>Binding Session
Session bound</pre>
	<p>You may close the listing window if you wish.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At the command prompt, run
	<pre>make run_client</pre>
	</li>
    <li>To shut down the Server while keeping NX running, unload the server using the File - Utilities - Unload Shared Images and select
    NXRemoteServerImpl.class.  This will unbind the server.  
    </li>
    <li>The server can be restarted by executing  NXRemoteServerImpl.class again.   
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>How to run this example with the client on a different host than the server</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Compile the client and server<pre>make</pre>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Start the rmiregistry and server<pre>make clean
make run_rmiregistry
make run_server</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Copy the client classes to the other host<p>Copy NXClient.class, 
	NXRemoteServer.class, and the Makefile to the computer where you 
	want to run the client.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>Run the client<pre>make HOST=&lt;<i>name of server's host</i>&gt; NXOPENJARDIR=&lt;<i>directory where NXOpen.jar is located</i>&gt; run_client</pre>
	<p>This does not need to be performed in the NX command prompt.&nbsp; HOST 
	is set to the internet address for the server.&nbsp; NXOPENJARDIR is set to 
	the directory where NXOpen.jar and NXOpenRemote.jar are located.&nbsp; 
	Inside an NX command prompt, NXOPENJARDIR is $UGII_BASE_DIR\nxbin.&nbsp; The make 
	command can be run without specifying the NXOPENJARDIR if the make command 
	is run inside an NX command prompt.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Properties used by the example</h4>
<dir>
	<li>nxexamples.remoting.host - Name of the host where the rmiregistry is 
	running</li>
	<li>nxexamples.remoting.servername - The server's name in the rmiregistry</li>
	<li>nxexamples.remoting.rmilookuptimeout - Maximum amount of the time, in 
	milliseconds, that the client should use to attempt to lookup the server 
	name in the RMI registry.&nbsp; If the server's name has not been registered 
	after this amount of time, the client will exit with a NotBoundException.&nbsp; 
	This property is used by the client only.  If you receive a NotBoundException, consider
	increasing the amount of time to wait for the server to be registered.</li>
