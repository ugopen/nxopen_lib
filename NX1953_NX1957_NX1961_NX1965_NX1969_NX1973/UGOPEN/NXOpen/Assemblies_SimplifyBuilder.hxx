                        This API is primarily intended for interactive NX session.
                        During preview, the destination part is established, simplified bodies are created in the 
                        destination part without uniting the bodies and the destination part is made a displayed part.
                        An error code will be returned in previewStatusCode if the preview was successfully created 
                        but had minor issues. In NXOpen program, invoking this preview API is not necessary.
                        The established destination part after preview is just an intermediate part not suitable for any
                        operation. Only after the user successfully commits and destroys the builder is the destination part 
                        suitable for any operation.
