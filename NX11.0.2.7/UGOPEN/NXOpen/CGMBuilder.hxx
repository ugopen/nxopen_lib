        Represents a @link NXOpen::CGMBuilder NXOpen::CGMBuilder@endlink  to be used when exporting the Current Display
        or drawing sheets to a CGM.  This class is created using @link NXOpen::PlotManager NXOpen::PlotManager@endlink .
        
        All sheets provided must be in the displayed part.
        
        The user must specify the sheets to be exported by setting the appropriate fields 
        through the @link NXOpen::PlotSourceBuilder NXOpen::PlotSourceBuilder@endlink .  
        
        If running in native mode, use the Filenames field to specify the full path location 
        of the CGM(s).
        
        If running Teamcenter, there are several options:
            1. Exporting a single CGM.  More than one sheet can be exported to one CGM if the Multiple
               option is set to Single.  The Dataset Name field must be filled with one 
               dataset name.
            2. Exporting multiple CGMs.  This requires the Dataset Names field to be filled with the
               same number of dataset names as sheets selected for export.  The Multiple option
               needs to be set to Individual for this functionality.
            3. Overwriting an existing CGM.  This requires the Dataset Name field to be filled
               with the dataset name that is to be overwritten.
            4. Export CGM(s) locally.  This is possible by setting the Action option to File Browser.
               If exporting locally then the Filenames field must be set with full path filenames.
        All options when exporting to Teamcenter require the Dataset Type and Named Reference Type
        fields to be set.
         <br> To create a new instance of this class, use @link NXOpen::PlotManager::CreateCgmBuilder  NXOpen::PlotManager::CreateCgmBuilder @endlink  <br> 
    Default values.
