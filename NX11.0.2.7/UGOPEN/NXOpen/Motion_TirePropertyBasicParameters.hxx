                        A file containing coefficients for the Magic Formula formulation of lateral force,

                        one-per-line, with the coefficient name first, followed by the value.
                        Blank lines and lines starting with a semicolon (;) or asterisk (*) are ignored.
                        The coefficient names are a single letter (A, B, or C) followed by a one-or two-digit suffix.
                        The values presently used are A0 through A19, B0 through B13, and C0 through C26.
                        The meaning of each coefficient is explained in the section on lateral force above.
                        In addition, several constants can be defined to perform conversions from Simcenter
                        model units to Magic Formula units. KFN converts normal force values, KSS converts steerslip values,
                        KRS converts steerslip values, KCAM converts camber values, KFRC converts output force values,
                        and KTRQ converts output torque values. For instance, a KSS value of 57.2958 might be used to
                        convert a steerslip angle (calculated in radians) to a Magic Formula steerslip angle (in degrees).
                        Likewise, a KTRQ value of 0.11302344 might be used to convert a Magic Formula output torque (calculated in N-m)
                        to a Simcenter torque (in in-lb). Regardless of its use, the constant always represents the conversion
                        factor to Magic Formula units.
