    /** Provides utility methods for managing licenses.
        
         <br> This class only manages the licenses that are used by the current NX Open
        application. If several applications are loaded in a session, each application will
        have its own independent license manager. It is possible for two applications to both
        reserve the same license.  Although this will only reserve a single license from the
        FLEX server, the license will not be released to the server until both applications
        have released it. 
         <br> 
        
         <br> 
        As of NX6 the concept of User-Defined License Contexts has been introduced.  This concept 
        gives greater control of licensing of the application.  To find out more about this topic, please 
        reference the NXOpen Programmer's Guide.  All user-defined context names have a max length of 128 
        characters long consisting of only numbers and letters.
         <br> 
        
         <br> 
        The main NX User Interface will also manage licenses independently. If an NX Open 
        application releases the "solid_modeling" license, but the main NX UI is still using that 
        license, then it will not be returned to the server.
         <br> 

         <br> Methods for this class use the license feature name, which can be found in the
        documentation for NX Open methods and properties. This is in the format 
        <tt>License requirements: license feature name ("license description")</tt>.  For
        example, given <tt>License requirements: solid_modeling ("SOLIDS MODELING")</tt>, then
        the license feature name, <tt>solid_modeling</tt> would be used. <br> 
        
      <br> To obtain an instance of this class, refer to @link NXOpen::Session  NXOpen::Session @endlink  <br>
