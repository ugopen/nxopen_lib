                 @brief Provides information about the inter-part relations (e.g. WAVE, inter-part
                expressions) in a NX model. 

          The returned XML string contains information from
                parts loaded in the NX session and from published TeamCenter data. The XML
                must be unmarshaled using the Browser_model_schema.xsd.The XML identifiers
                are valid for the life of the session and are used in sequent queries.
                
                For the selected parts, the queries return the first level parent (source) and
                child (target) parts. The object-object relations that comprise a part-part
                relation are included if the information is available. Each query provides a
                context for the meaning of a selected part. For example, the work part is the
                only selected part for GetWorkPartWithPartRelationsXml. However, the method
                GetPartsInContextAssemblyXml considers all the unique parts in the context
                assembly to be selected.
                
                Since the queries also return the first level parent and child parents, these
                non-selected parts could exist only in TeamCenter.
              <br> This is an abstract class, and cannot be created.  <br>
