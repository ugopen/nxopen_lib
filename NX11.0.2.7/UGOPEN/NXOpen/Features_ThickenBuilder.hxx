            Represents a builder for a @link NXOpen::Features::Thicken NXOpen::Features::Thicken@endlink  feature. This allows creation and editing of a Thicken feature which takes a set of faces 
            and offsets them along their normals to create a solid body which has constant thickness. Since this can not be done precisely for the supported geometry 
            types there is a tolerance to specify the accuracy of the result. Inputs to this class can be convergent objects.
             <br> To create a new instance of this class, use @link NXOpen::Features::FeatureCollection::CreateThickenBuilder  NXOpen::Features::FeatureCollection::CreateThickenBuilder @endlink  <br> 
        Default values.
