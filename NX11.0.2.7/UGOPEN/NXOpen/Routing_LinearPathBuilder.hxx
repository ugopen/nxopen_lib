                To create a control point (and it's associated segment) first create
                a preview control point, then define the control point using either
                a smart point (@link Routing::LinearPathBuilder::SetControlPointDefiningPoint Routing::LinearPathBuilder::SetControlPointDefiningPoint@endlink ), 
                or some other object 
                (@link Routing::LinearPathBuilder::SetControlPointDefiningObject Routing::LinearPathBuilder::SetControlPointDefiningObject@endlink ).
