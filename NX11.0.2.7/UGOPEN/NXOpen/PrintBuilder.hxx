        Represents a @link NXOpen::PrintBuilder NXOpen::PrintBuilder@endlink .  This class is for use on Windows only and 
        contains all information relating to printing.  It is created using @link NXOpen::PlotManager NXOpen::PlotManager@endlink .
        
        All sheets provided must be in the displayed part.
        
        The user must specify the sheets to be printed by setting the appropriate fields 
        through the @link NXOpen::PlotSourceBuilder NXOpen::PlotSourceBuilder@endlink .  The printer text and copies fields must be
        set in order to successfully print the provided sheets.  The printer text is the path of the 
        desired printer and the copies field represents the number of copies to be printed.  This class
        also allows for the line widths to be scaled by setting the appropriate thin, normal, or thick
        scale factors.
         <br> To create a new instance of this class, use @link NXOpen::PlotManager::CreatePrintBuilder  NXOpen::PlotManager::CreatePrintBuilder @endlink  <br>
